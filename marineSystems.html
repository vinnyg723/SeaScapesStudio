          <p>Building a marine aquarium system is almost like beginning a mini-degree program in marine biology.
            Anyone
            who is fascinated by marine organisms and their natural histories is thinking like a biologist. Building a
            marine system is behaving like a biologist. An aquarium provides a fascinating way to explore the
            incredible
            world of marine biology. Many people interested in freshwater aquaria eventually build a marine system
            because of the new world of opportunities it offers. There are many different species of corals that have
            not even been described or named. Some end up in aquaria and are studied by a hobbyist before they are
            named
            by a biologist!
            Consider the type of marine aquarium you want to build. Before you think about tanks, stands, and hoods,
            consider what you imagine you want to care for.<br><br>
            1. You can build an invertebrate- only system that contains corals, sponges, mollusks, worms, and
            echinoderms,
            and crustaceans. For some, these systems are fascinating studies in marine biology.
            <br><br>2. Fish-only systems are the easiest marine system to care for. The vast arrays of colors, sizes,
            shapes, and
            behaviors available to the home aquarist are dazzling. Fish have personalities that many invertebrates
            cannot display. They often "recognize" their owners and are quite entertaining to watch, especially at
            feeding time.
            <br><br>3. Reef systems generally contain invertebrates and fish. These are the systems that most home
            aquarists want
            to build. These systems maximize the numbers of different organisms that can be studied in a single
            system.
            <br><br>Whatever you decide to build, research the species you will be housing before you buy them. Be
            sure that you
            have not picked a fish because of its color or shape only. Each species of marine life has its own natural
            history story. Know the story before you add it to your system.
            <h5><strong>Some things to consider regarding fish:</strong></h5>
            1. Some fish are peaceful while others are aggressive. Many "peaceful" fish are aggressive with their own
            species while unaggressive with other species. Some fish are aggressive with nearly everything!!
            <br><br>2. Some fish prefer to live solitary lives and others want to school among their own species.
            <br><br>3. Some fish have difficult dietary requirements and may feed only on coral polyps. Other fish
            will accept
            flake food. Most will accept frozen shrimp products.
            <br><br>4. Some fish require large spaces or hiding places or high water flow.
            <br><br>5. Large fish require more space than smaller ones. Some 5 inch fish require more space than other
            8 inch fish
            because of swimming behaviors.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Invertebrates like corals also have their own unique preferences:</strong></h5>
            1. Water flow has a large impact on corals. Some require high and others much less. Find out what you
            need.
            Linear or turbulent water flow is very hard to produce in cylindrical tank designs.
            <br><br>2. Lighting is very important for corals. Corals and some mollusks have algae within their cells
            that produce
            some or all of their food requirements. The algae require light for photosynthesis, and they provide some
            of
            the foodstuffs they make for their hosts.
            <br><br>3. Some invertebrates require far more space than others. Small basket stars use huge amounts of
            space to
            capture their food. Some start small and grow to quite large size.
            <br><br>Whatever you consider, the important thing to do is to visit your local saltwater fish store and
            talk to
            someone there. Look at what's available. Use a great text or the world wide web to research the natural
            history of the organisms that perk your interest. You will be far more satisfied at the end result when
            you
            are prepared to build a system that matches your interest.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2 id="equipment" class="anchor"><strong>Equipment</strong></h2>
          <p>Once you have considered the types of animals you want, you will want to research the types of
            equipment that will be needed to house them. Each component is available from a number of different
            manufacturers. Each manufacturer produces variations of every piece of equipment. You will need to talk
            with other aquarists and your local fish store about equipment before you make your purchases. The
            system parts fall into 3 general categories. They either hold the bulk of the water, light the water, or
            cleanse and move the water.
            <h5><strong>Parts that hold the water:</strong></h5>
            1. Aquarium: ranging in size from a few gallon into the hundreds, aquariums are by no means standard.
            The two basic aquariums are made of either glass or acrylic.
            <br><br>2. Stand: ranging from wrought iron to wood, the stand has to be tough and able to support an
            enormous amount of weight.
            <br><br>3. Cover: from simple plastic or glass sheets to elaborate hoods, this keeps the water and fish
            in and people (most) out.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Parts that light the aquarium:</strong></h5>
            Lighting and Hood
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Parts that move and cleanse water:</strong></h5>
            Filtration refers to the cleansing of water by some type chemical or physical means. There are many
            types of filtration systems available today that were not available 30 years ago.
            All filters perform some or all of the following tasks:
            <br><br>1. Mechanical filtration is the entrapment of debris from a water system. It usually employs
            some type of floss or pad material that catches objects as water passes through, much like a furnace air
            filter in a home.
            <br><br>2. Chemical filtration is the use of chemical bonding to remove substances from water. Iron
            oxide is use to remove phosphorus from aquarium systems this way. Activated carbon is used to remove
            organic compounds from water in this way also.
            <br><br>3. Biological filtration is the growth of beneficial nitrogen-cycling bacteria that process
            nitrogen in aquarium systems to prevent it from killing livestock.
            <br><br>4. Sterilization involves the use of high energy light or oxidizing agents to improve the
            quality of a water system.
            <br><br>Different types of filtration options perform one or more of these tasks. Each system tends to
            perform one of the tasks best. Mechanical and biological filtration are essential to the day-to-day
            operation of marine life of any saltwater aquarium. Chemical and sterilization techniques are useful in
            short-use cycles and as optional methods for treating specific problems.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Mechanical and Biological Filtration Options:</strong></h5>
            1. The Undergravel Filter is a 50+ year old filter option that some aquarists still use. This method is
            losing popularity because of better options that are now available. It was once considered the most
            important part of the filtration system of any setup.
            <br><br>2. Internal filters have a limited role, especially in hospital and quarantine tanks where very
            little biomass is present so little filtration is needed.
            <br><br>3. External filters are used by some aquarists for their ease of cleaning and quiet operation.
            They are clean and simple to operate.
            <br><br>4. Sump filtration systems use a separate aquarium to filter water. The water is passed through
            pads that screen debris, barriers that churn and oxygenate water, and often live rock or sand that help
            biologically filter the water.
            <br><br>5. Refugiums are a modification of the sump concept to enhance the biological filtration
            capacity. They employ the use of algae and even plants (mangroves) under lights in a sump aquarium. Live
            sand and mud is employed to help biologically and physically filter aquarium water.
            <br><br>6. Live rock and sand are now used in sumps and aquaria to enhance biological filtration. Old
            marine systems employed lifeless decorator rock to enhance aquarium appearance and add refuges for
            animals. Today, rock is removed from rubble systems, washed (hopefully), and sold to aquarists for both
            aesthetics and biological filtration.
            <br><br>7. Fluidized-bed filters are rather new types of filters that increase the surface area for the
            growth of beneficial bacteria. A fine granular material is suspended in a filter canister which allows
            microbes to grow and process nitrogen.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Chemical Filtration Options:</strong></h5>
            1. Activated carbon is used to remove suspended organic compounds from water. This is often used in
            short-term interventions when suspended organic material is in excess.
            <br><br>2. Ion exchange devices work to chemically remove specific types of solutes from marine aquarium
            water. Resins bind to specific molecules such as nitrate or phosphate and remove them from solution. The
            resin beads are housed in nylon or polyester bags that are simple to remove from a mechanical filtration
            device. These devices are used in deionization filters that convert tap water to water safe for use in a
            marine aquarium.
            <br><br>3. Poly filters employ pads to remove toxic compounds from the aquarium water. The pads change
            color as they become loaded with compounds, indicating the end of the media life.
            <br><br>4. Protein skimmers rely on the chemistry of lipids and proteins to remove them water solutions.
            They originated over 40 years ago but have only gained popularity in the last 15 years. They are
            considered an essential component of any competent marine system.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Sterilization Options:</strong></h5>
            1. Ozone is an oxidizing agent that releases oxygen as it reacts with organic material. As an oxidizing
            agent it is safe for use in marine systems, and really helps to clarify water.
            <br><br>2. Ultraviolet sterilizers destroy microbes with high energy light. They have gained popularity
            in recent years but should only serve as an accessory to an already well-designed filtration system.
          </p><br>
          <h2 id="setup" class="anchor"><strong>Setup</strong></h2>
          <p>Setting up an aquarium is the most exciting part of the aquarium hobby. Hopefully you have considered
            the types of animals you want to care for and how much money you are willing to spend, which will
            determine the type of system you will assemble. You should have researched the different types
            aquariums, stands, lights, hoods, filters, etc. and have decided what you need. It may take you time to
            gather everything you need. Make a list - on paper or computer - to help you remember everything you
            need. Talk to your local fish store and see what you can get from them. A local store can be invaluable
            in helping you get advice and materials you will need. You may need to go online to find some equipment.
            Once you have bought all of your components, you will need to read instructions on each component. Get
            to know the equipment BEFORE you install it. Then you will begin the assembly of your aquarium.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Equipment to Start a New Aquarium</strong></h5>
            Aquarium, stand, light fixtures, bulbs, hood, filter, pumps, hoses, media, protein skimmer, salt mix,
            hydrometer, thermometer, heater (if needed), live sand and rock
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>You will need to do the following:</strong></h5>
            1. Put together skimmers, pumps, light fixtures, hoods, stands, etc. Be sure that you understand
            everything before you begin final assembly
            <br><br>2. Place the stand where it will be. Check it is level. If not, level the stand by leveling the
            base at the floor, not the top where it contacts the aquarium. Place a piece of foam on the stand top to
            place the aquarium onto. Put the aquarium on the foam and stand, and check level. If it is not level,
            remove and level. Once the tank is placed and level, you should begin assembly of the filter and hood.
            You will not put any gravel or rock into the tank at this time. You will be adding water slowly to make
            sure the tank has no leaks. Hook up the filter and tighten all fittings. Be sure that before you fill
            the tank, no water can leak.
            <br><br>3. Fill the tank with fresh water. Once the tank is full, turn on the filter and check its
            operation. If you have one, hook up the protein skimmer and turn it on. If it is working correctly, put
            on the hood and light fixture and turn on the lights. Let the aquarium sit with water for one day,
            filter running for 24 hours and tank running a normal photoperiod.
            <br><br>4. Check for leaks, everywhere. Look at fittings, filter seals, aquarium seams, and the floor.
            If there are no leaks, proceed on. Empty the aquarium, filter, and other parts. If there was a leak, get
            the parts replaced. If not, proceed on!
            <br><br>5. Mix your saltwater. Large heavy duty trash cans that are new and clean work great for this.
            If they are on wheels its an added bonus. Mixing saltwater takes some time. A power head in the water
            helps immensely to circulate and mix the salt. Keep the can clean - you will need it again and again and
            again and again. You will need about 1.4 pounds of salt mix per gallon of water to produce a specific
            gravity of 1.024 (approximately). Don't bother checking salinity until at least several hours have
            passed. Let the water stand in the container with a pump circulating it.
            <br><br>6. Prepare your aquarium. If you have a background for the back wall, apply it now. It will
            likely adhere to the outside of the back wall. You can paint it also. After you have the back wall
            prepared, you are ready to begin filling.
            <br><br>7. Pump the water or bucket it from the mixing container to the aquarium. Don't fill to the top
            - you still have to add your aquascaping material and sand. Once you are within several inches of top,
            stop filling and save the extra saltwater for a water change. Start up the pumps, filters, and skimmer
            (if you have one) and let the water circulate.
            <br><br>8. Add the sand to the aquarium. If it is "live" sand, do not rinse it. If it is "dead" sand,
            you should rinse it with tap water until it rinses clear. Stir it around while rinsing to be sure you
            get most of the dust out. This is best done outside where you can let the rinse water overflow the rinse
            bucket and carry the dust away on the ground. Either rinsed "dead" sand or unrinsed "live" sand - add to
            the aquarium. Add 1 to 2 inches of "dead" sand or 3 to 4 inches of "live" sand.
            <br><br>9. Add your aquascaping of either dried rock or live rock. Dried rock can be freshwater rinsed
            but live rock should be added straight to the aquarium. Leave at least 3 inches between the sides and
            front to allow for class cleaning and fish movement. Place rocks so they cannot tumble into the front
            glass.
            <br><br>10. Restart all systems - filter, heater, etc... Do not run the skimmer just yet. Check for
            leaks.
            <br><br>11. After a day or two, begin checking water chemistry. Test pH and specific gravity. If it will
            be a reef system, also check calcium and hardness. Adjust if necessary. Run the lights for 2 or 3 hours
            per day.
            <br><br>12. If the rock and sand were not live, seed the system with a handful of live sand. Then add
            some fish food every two days to add some protein and ultimately ammonia to the system. This will get
            the nitrogen cycle going.
            <br><br>13. Test the water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate every other day until ammonia and nitrite
            are 0. Clean the aquarium glass as needed. Run the lights for normal day light periods.
            <br><br>14. If nitrites and ammonia are 0, after at least 4 weeks, buy one fish that you want for your
            community, the hardiest you have picked. Acclimate it and observe it for one week. Start your protein
            skimmer and keep it running.
            <br><br>15 If your fish remains healthy, continue to buy one fish per week and continue observing.
            Continue to check water quality - salinity, pH, nitrite, and ammonia, also calcium and hardness if
            corals are involved. Adjust as needed.
            <br><br>16. Enter your routine maintenance schedule and continue to add stock. Once the tank has been
            set up for one month and new stock is being added to existing stock, it is a very good idea to set up a
            quarantine tank to stage the addition of new arrivals to your aquarium.
            <br><br>17. Congratulations - you are now a marine aquarist!!!
            <br><br>
            There are many helpful online to help you with adding fish and invertebrates, water quality
            testing, and livestock natural history. Use them or a good textbook and keep yourself on track. Good
            luck!

            <h5><strong>Water Replacement:</strong></h5> Because of the gradual and significant evaporative water
            loss from an aquariums system, water must be added to maintain salinity at 1.024 g/ml. The water that is
            added should be filtered and not poured directly from any tap source. Municipal water treatment
            generally involves the addition of chlorine (Cl2(g)) and chloramine (NH2Cl(aq)) to destroy viruses and
            kill microbes. Tap water chlorine levels are usually at least 3 mg/L and chloramine levels are at least
            1.0 mg/L. Chlorine levels greater than 0.002 mg/L are deleterious to marine life. In addition, tap water
            contains dissolved solids, dissolved minerals (including those from house plumbing tubing), phosphates,
            and other impurities. It is important that all of these be removed before adding tap water to a marine
            system. Also - tap water from the hot water plumbing should NEVER be purified for addition to a marine
            aquarium system. It has more dissolved metals than the cold water system, which will shorten the life of
            the purification system.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Reverse Osmosis:</strong></h5> This purification system uses high water pressure to push
            water through a barrier that other solutes cannot pass. The cellulose acetate or polyamide polymer
            membranes of these systems have very small pore sizes (1.5 nanometers) that will reject dissolved
            substances but will allow water to pass. These systems produce water with substance removal rates of 90%
            to 99.5%. The only drawback of this system is the waste of water - the water that does not pass through
            the membrane containing concentrated solutes is discarded. Most reverse osmosis systems use pre-filters
            to remove dissolved solids and prolong the life of the purification membrane. They tend to be cheaper to
            operate and require less maintenance than other purification systems.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Deionization:</strong></h5> This purification system uses resin beads impregnated with very
            small pores (2 to 5 nm). To make the beads deionize, they are exposed to either strong acids or strong
            bases to load them with hydrogen or hydroxide ions. The beads are loaded into a canister through which
            tap water is allowed to flow. As cations (positive ions) and anions (negative ions) of tap water flow
            between the beads, they exchange ions with them. The principal ions in tap water - calcium, magnesium,
            sodium, potassium, copper, lead, nitrate, bicarbonate, sulfate, chloride, and iodide - end up stuck on
            the bead surface. As the beads becomes saturated with tap water impurities, their pH and color change,
            indicating they should be recharged or replaced. Tap water passed through a deionization system can be
            up to 99.5% free of dissolved ions. Pre-filters may be needed to prolong the life of the resin beads.
            Carbon reactors may be needed to remove organic impurities.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Final Notes:</strong></h5>
            <br><br>1. Tap water should not be used to replace evaporated salt water in an aquarium.
            <br><br>2. The most important aspect of aquarium salinity is stability. As water evaporates from an
            aquarium, salinity rises. Removal of saltwater, salt spray, and protein skimmers lower salinity. Barring
            leakage, evaporation exceeds salt spray in most systems and salinity gradually falls over time. Any and
            all adjustments must be made GRADUALLY. Saltwater fish can tolerate salinity that it not optimal, but
            what is often fatal is rapid salinity change. The addition of water or salt to an aquarium system should
            be done gradually to avoid wide fluctuations in salinity.
          </p><br>
          <h2 id="nCycle" class="anchor"><strong>Nitrogen Cycle</strong></h2>
          <p>The Nitrogen Cycle describes the movement of nitrogen, a nonmetal element, through an ecosystem.
            Aquariums have their own unique issues with respect to this cycle. Nitrogen gas, ammonia, nitrites,
            nitrates, and proteins are all part of the story. Ultimately, all organisms must get nitrogen from some
            source to build their proteins, ann activity central to life on earth. Bacteria and blue-green bacteria
            play key roles at critical points in the cycle.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Nitrogen gas (N2):</strong></h5> Earth's nitrogen reservoir is the nitrogen gas in air, at
            almost 80% by volume. The only marine organisms that can use nitrogen gas in a chemical reaction are
            specific types of bacteria. These species of bacteria can convert nitrogen gas to ammonia, a process
            called nitrogen fixation. Two bacteria that have been studied are the planktonic Azotobacter and the
            benthic Clostridium. Thus, the aqueous nitrogen gas of seawater is inert but becomes active when it is
            converted to ammonia (highly poisonous) by bacteria.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Ammonia (NH3):</strong></h5> Ammonia produced by nitrogen fixation in an aquarium is usually
            of negligible quantity compared to that produced by the metabolism of protein by animals and bacteria.
            Aqueous ammonia gas (NH3 (aq)) is the most toxic and dangerous of all the nitrogen cycle compounds. Most
            of the ammonia reacts with water to form ammonium ions (NH4 (aq)), rendering it less toxic. Some species
            of aerobic bacteria, Nitrosomonas, and Nitrosococcus (purple sulfur bacteria) found in marine sediment,
            are chemoautotrophic and consume ammonia (NH3/NH4+). Their oxidation of ammonia produces nitrite, NO2-.
            This process is the first step of nitrification, called nitrosification. Ammonia and nitrite levels
            should be or nearly be 0 in the seawater of an aquarium.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Nitrite (NO2-):</strong></h5> Nitrite is metabolized by other nitrifying genera of bacteria:
            Nitrobacter (alpha proteobacteria), Nitrospina (delta proteobacteria), and Nitrococcus (gamma
            proteobacteria/purple sulfur bacteria). These aerobic bacteria oxidize the nitrite to nitrate. Nitrates
            are far less toxic than ammonia or nitrites. The conversion of nitrite (NO2-) to nitrate (NO3-) is the
            2nd step of nitrification. While nitrite levels should be 0, nitrate levels in aquarium seawater can
            safely range from 0 to 10 mg/L for corals, up to 50 mg/L for fish.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Nitrates: (NO3-):</strong></h5> The removal of nitrates from sea water is accomplished via
            uptake by algae or by anaerobic bacterial reduction of the nitrate to nitrogen gas. Under anaerobic
            conditions, bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, and Paracoccus convert nitrates to nitrogen gas,
            in a process called denitrification. These bacteria are facultative anaerobes, and can grow in the sand,
            where water flow is minimal and oxygen levels are low. They participate in the removal of nitrogen from
            the aquarium system, because the gases they produce from nitrate reduction escape to the atmosphere.
            Note: one of the products of denitrification is ammonia, which is then consumed by nitrifying bacteria.
            Also, denitrification can only occur under anaerobic conditions. Nitrates are also used by marine algae,
            both microscopic and macroscopic, to produce protein. Phytoplankton, coralline algae, Caulerpa, Ulva are
            only a few of the organisms that rely on nitrates for their source of nitrogen. The amount of nitrate
            available to these organisms directly determines their growth potential. Algae can be used to
            biologically control the nitrate levels in a marine aquarium.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Protein:</strong></h5> Proteins make up the structural material that binds bodies together.
            Enzymes, the catalysts of chemical reactions, are also proteins. Excess protein produced by animals is
            metabolized to carbohydrate and ammonia is released as a waste product.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Inputs to the Aquarium Nitrogen Cycle:</strong></h5> Animals digest food protein to make
            their own protein. They metabolize excess protein to produce other biochemicals, and release the waste
            product ammonia to the water around them. Foods high in protein, such as frozen Mysis or brine shrimp
            can add aquarium bioload. Decomposition of excess food by such bacteria as Bacillus adds ammonia to
            aquarium water. High levels of nitrosifying bacteria are needed to process the excess ammonia.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>New Aquariums:</strong></h5> If key species of the nitrogen cycle are absent from an
            aquarium, a chemical bottleneck will occur. Their component builds up in the water, possibly to toxic
            proportions. For example, if Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus are absent, ammonia will build up to toxic
            levels, but there would be little or no nitrate or nitrite in the aquarium system. Normally, a period of
            several weeks is required after initial setup before animals are introduced. This allows an aquarium
            system to grow the bacteria/algae necessary to complete the entire nitrogen cycle. Live rock and sand
            greatly accelerates the acclimation process. Once all bacterial "players" in the nitrogen cycle are
            present, nitrogen should cycle through the aquarium system and end up in the algae. Harvesting algae
            from the aquarium and consumption of algae by fish moves the nitrogen through the food chain.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Protein Skimmers:</strong></h5> Protein skimmers benefit an aquarium by removing dissolved
            organic substances from water, including proteins. This prevents the proteins from being metabolized to
            carbohydrate and ammonia by bacteria, which could toxify an aquarium.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Final Notes:</strong></h5>
            1. All new marine aquarium systems must be allowed to "cycle" for at least 2 weeks and possibly "seeded"
            with live rock and live sand to accelerate the growth of nitrogen cycling bacteria. During this time
            there should be no animals in the aquarium. After two weeks, only a few animals at a time should be
            added with days between additions. This will allow the aquarium populations of nitrogen cycling species
            to grow to the necessary levels required to keep nitrogen compounds at minimal levels.
            <br><br>2. Refugium biological filtration systems with live rock and gravel beds increase the
            populations of nitrogen cycling bacteria and will likely increase the carrying capacity of any marine
            system. The more rock and gravel surface present, the greater the habitat for nitrogen cycling bacteria
            to grow. Denitrification will require anaerobic conditions, which a deep gravel bed in a refugium
            provides.
            <br><br>3. Quality test kits should be used weekly to determine the status of a marine system nitrogen
            cycle, including ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate.
            <br><br>4. One of the simplest means of remediating unacceptable ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate levels is
            regular water changes with purified (not tap) water.
            <br><br>5. In summary:
            Aerobic processes add nitrates to the system (nitrification).
            Anaerobic processes (denitrification) and aerobic algae (nitrate uptake) remove nitrates from the
            system.
            Filters and media must balance aerobic and anaerobic+uptake processes to properly process nitrogen in a
            marine system. There must be aerobic and anaerobic regions in an aquarium for these processes to occur.
            Live rock and sand is currently believed to be the best system for both of these to occur.
          </p><br>
          <h2 id="stock" class="anchor"><strong>Stock</strong></h2>
          <p>In setting up a new tank, the most important thing to remember is: PATIENCE. One of the important
            components of a marine system is the community of tiny microbes that will begin to grow on all all the
            surfaces in the tank. While the algae are visible and often unwanted, the bacteria are usually invisible
            and much desired. Many species of Nitrobacter, Nitrosomonas, and other gram-negative bacteria will
            populate the unseen areas of the aquarium rock and sand. They grow much more slowly than other types of
            bacteria. It will take a week or two to allow them to even reach marginal population sizes. Their
            importance lies in their cycling of nitrogen compounds in the aquarium. Fish and other animals produce
            nitrogenous waste that will build up and kill them. There are no mechanical filters that can remove
            these wastes. They have to be "biologically" filtered. Most filters simply allow the proliferation of
            these nitrogen-cycling bacteria, which maintains good water quality. These nitrogen-cycling bacteria ARE
            the biological filtration of a marine aquarium.
            Next, all marine systems should employ a quarantine tank that serves as a staging area between a store
            system and the home aquarium system. The quarantine tank should be a 10 gallon aquarium with a good lid
            (to prevent jump-outs), heater, and power head. It is much simpler to treat diseases in a small aquarium
            than a home aquarium. All new additions should be observed for two weeks for addition to the show
            aquarium.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>The procedure for quarantine tank implementation is:</strong></h5>
            1. Pick a simple aquarium, from 10 to 50 gallons. Use siphoned water from your show aquarium to fill the
            quarantine aquarium - that way the fish can move form the quarantine tank to the show tank without much
            acclimation. Use a power head and a sponge filter to maintain the quarantine tank water quality. Put
            only small PVC pipe pieces or other materials on the bottom. Do not put in live rock or sand.
            <br><br>2. Get water quality test kits - pH, ammonia, nitrite, etc...
            <br><br>3. Get a basic first aid kit. This would possibly include: kanamycin, furanace, and a
            copper-based medication. If you can get it - praziquantel - for worms. These will kill most parasites
            you will encounter.
            <br><br>4. After floating the fish bag to equalize temperature, dip new additions in a bath of filtered
            fresh water (RO or DI) for 2 to 10 minutes, with constant observation throughout. Dip water must be the
            same pH and temperature as the water it is dipped from, which should be the same as the quarantine tank.
            If a fish seems overly stressed, they should be immediately moved to the quarantine tank. A dip solution
            can be 1 oz of 37% formalin to 5 gallons of filtered water, or 8 drops of methylene blue per gallon (up
            to 50 mg/L).
            <br><br>5. Observe all newcomers in the quarantine tank daily for 2 weeks and be prepared to remediate
            any parasitic problems that appear. The tank is small and parasites get out of hand quickly.
            <br><br>6. After two weeks of normal fish observation, the fish can be moved to a small container and,
            with a drip hose, be acclimated to the home aquarium. If the fish develops any type of disease, it must
            continue to be quarantined for two weeks AFTER its infection is completely clear.
            <br><br> Fish should be carefully picked for your home aquarium. Do not try to match colors or sizes.
            Each fish genus has behavioral peculiarities which will not be adjusted by your home aquarium. Some
            species are more aggressive than others, some whole fish families have issues that must be addressed.
            Each fish sold at SeaScape Studio is described on the web. Its size, natural feeding habits, and general
            natural history are described. Consider using this or a good text to research which fish would be best
            for your system. It might be great to have a 1 inch yellow boxfish in your 29 gallon nanocube, but when
            it reaches 10 inches you will have a problem....
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Some general livestock guidelines</strong></h5>
            1. Use the size of your aquarium as a general guideline for fish and invertebrate selection. Some fish
            are very active and need larger space than other fish the same size. Other fish are sedentary and can
            tolerate the opposite.
            <br><br>2. If you have a reef system, pay close attention to "reef compatibility" guidelines. Many fish,
            such as triggers, butterflies, and angels pick at the polyps of corals. Some invertebrates, such as
            shrimp, crabs, and starfish, do the same. Consult our guide or a good text for compatibility
            information.
            <br><br>3. Pay close attention to temperament. Aggressive fish, such as some tangs, dottybacks, angels,
            and clownfish may pick on other species of fish. Even though no two fish are the same, use the general
            guidelines available here or in a good text to build the type of aquarium you want. If you wish to have
            tangs, then you will need to mix them with other aggressive fish to avoid deaths in the aquarium.
            Peaceful fish will be harassed by aggressive fish if they are mixed together.
            <br><br>4. Consider only buying one species of a particular fish unless you know that multiple members
            of the species can co-habitate in an aquarium of your size. While some fish, such as damsels and
            cardinals, can tolerate one another well, other species will fight with each other, some until death. It
            is always safer to house one of each species than more than one.

          <h2 id="maintenance" class="anchor"><strong>Maintenance</strong></h2>
          <p>Maintenance is the foundation of a great aquarium system. It requires a schedule and small blocks of
            time. If an aquarium system was thoughtfully prepared, set up, and stocked, less time is required to
            maintain it than the time required to maintain a pet dog! There are things that should be checked daily,
            that take seconds to minutes at most. Other conditions should be checked and remediated weekly, monthly,
            or even annually. A journal or log book helps immensely to keep track of what has been done and what
            needs to be done.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Daily</strong></h5>
            a. Feed and check animals: Some animals will need to be fed more than once per day and others may need a
            once daily feeding. A refugium that cultivates copepods and amphipods can benefit a system and an owner
            by lowering the amount of time spent feeding. Check if all fish appear healthy and are behaving
            normally.
            <br><br>b. Check conditions: All aquariums should at least have a thermometer to find temperature. There
            are sophisticated aquarium monitoring systems that can report pH, hardness, salinity, and more. Some can
            even transmit information to an owner via the internet. The more conditions checked daily, the less
            likelihood of negative surprises.
            <br><br>c. Check water flow - Pumps should be checked audibly for water flow. Reduced water flow must be
            investigated and remediated.
            <br><br>d. Empty skimmer - Aquariums with a high bioload of dissolved organic material will require
            daily skimmer cleaning. The more animals in the aquarium, the more cleanings the skimmer will require.
            <br><br>e. Top off water: If a system is tightly closed without much water churning, evaporation may be
            minimal. Such systems may need filling only once per week. Systems with sump waterfalls will likely
            require topping more often when in really dry air conditions. Obviously, clean filtered water should be
            used, not salt water.
            <br><br>f. Clean glass: Especially in new systems, algae that grows over the front glass should be
            scraped away. Magnetic glass cleaners are great for this job. Accumulated algae that is allowed to grow
            on the glass for longer periods of time if tougher to scrape off.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Weekly</strong></h5>
            a. Water quality testing and intervention: Water conditions that should be tested weekly in a reef
            system include: salinity, pH, alkalinity. If the system is new, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, calcium,
            magnesium, phosphate should be checked.
            <br><br>b. Check filtration material: The filtration screens and filler must be checked and cleaned or
            replaced as needed. This is important to help maintain flow and oxygenation in the aquarium system.
            <br><br>c. Change water: Siphoning off water and replacing it with fresh-mixed saltwater is very
            important to the maintenance of water quality. Most water quality issues can be avoided by following
            this simple rule - change 5% to 10% of the water weekly. Always use filtered water - either RO or DI -
            to mix the new saltwater.
            <br><br>d. Clean glass and hood: By wiping the good and glass, and some of the underside of the hood,
            you can avoid salt buildup which gets more difficult to remove the longer it is present on the surface.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Monthly</strong></h5>
            a. Change water while siphoning debris: If weekly water changes were not performed (vacation or other
            issues) then change 10% to 20% of the water with fresh mixed saltwater. Again use RO or DI water as
            the source for the new salt mix. Try to siphon water from the bottom of the aquarium to pick up debris
            that has accumulated.
            <br><br>b. Perform a "deep" cleaning of the filter system: Clean and siphon as much organic material
            from the sump or refugium areas where it should not be and remove it from the system. This goes a long
            way to maintaining a high quality marine water system.
            <br><br>c. Inspect lights, pumps, heater: Check that the bulb connections are not rusted and that
            pumps and heater are still functioning normally. Visually inspect all pumps, hoses, cords, and
            overflows to ensure that nothing is awry. If a pump has a water-cooling feature, be sure that the
            conduit tube is open. Check heaters to be sure they were not moved and cracked. If the heater is
            glass, look carefully into it and check for condensation which is an obvious sign of leakage. Be sure
            that all hose fittings are tight and not leaking. Check air stones in skimmers to ensure they are
            still working. Visually inspect the entire system.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Long Term</strong></h5>
            a. Be prepared to replace bulbs. Have replacement bulbs ready and on-hand so that a burned-out bulb
            can be replaced immediately.
            <br><br>b. Change some substrate: Remove some substrate in the sump or aquarium and replace with new
            materials. The live rock in the sump does deteriorate over time and may need some replacement.
            <br><br>c. Check plumbing: Check plastics - hoses and tubes - and be prepared to replace them as
            needed. Plastic plumbing is inexpensive and does not last forever. PVC piping is very long-lasting but
            vinyl and thin plastic hose is not. Check all fittings for leakage.
            <br><br>d. Check pumps, especially impellers and shafts, when filters are being cleaned to ensure they
            are not near failure. Visually inspect the entire system and remediate issues as required.
          </p><br>
          <h2 id="diet" class="anchor"><strong>Diet</strong></h2>
          <p>Diet is the food that is consumed by an animal. Marine animals are categorized into 3 groups:
            Herbivores (those that eat algae), Carnivores (those that eat other animals), and Omnivores (those that
            eat both plants and animals). In reality, nearly all marine fish are omnivores. Carnivores consume some
            plant material, often accidentally, as they hunt for herbivores. Herbivores often eat small animals as
            they consume algae. These small "accidental" foods are very important to the long term health of any
            marine organism. Providing a balanced diet in the marine aquarium must pay attention to this fact.

            </table>
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Foods:</strong></h5> Foods available to the marine aquarist fall into several categories:
            Live Algae, Live Animal Foods, Frozen Foods, Dry Foods, Table Foods, and Home-Made Meals.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Live Algae:</strong></h5> There are several species of algae that are available to the
            marine aquarist as a food source for fish. They are all good sources of vitamins, EPA (eicosapentaenoic
            acid), and trace minerals.
            <br><br>a. Caulerpa includes a number of species of algae that are suitable as food. It has been banned
            in California because of its invasiveness in coastal waters.
            <br><br>b. Gracilaria is a stringy red algae that is very nutritious.
            <br><br>c. Ulva is a green algae that grows in large wrinkled sheets, which can be torn and fed to
            herbivores.
            <br><br>d. Sargassum is a species of brown algae that is very nutritious.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Live Animal Foods include:</strong></h5>
            <br><br>a. Brine Shrimp (Artemia sp.) - newly hatched forms are very nutritious for small fish, and
            often important to the acclimation of mandarins and gobies. Newly hatched brine shrimp (under 48 hours
            age) are very high in nutrition at about 70% protein and 18% lipid. They should not be fed continuously
            to fish. Adult brine shrimp have low nutritional value unless they were fed an enriched diet.
            <br><br>b. Grass/Ghost Shrimp - Palaemon sp. shrimp can be collected and fed to aquarium fish. They can
            be preloaded with nutrition algae such as Spirulina and then fed to fish.
            <br><br>c. Copepods range in size from less than a millimeter to about a centimeter in
            length. They are crustaceans that form an important link between algae and many of the ocean's smaller
            carnivores. They can be cultivated in refugiums or bought. Available forms include "Arcti-Pods&auot;,
            "Reef Plankton", and "Tigger Pods".
            <br><br>d. Amphipods are small crustaceans with a different body structure than copepods, being more
            shrimp-like. Gammarus is a common amphipod that is often transported with live rock or macroalgae. They
            feed on detritus and algae in a refugium or aquarium.
            <br><br>e. Feeder Fish are used to feed large carnivorous fish like lionfishes and rockfishes. Marine
            feeder fish are expensive and usually not offered as food. Freshwater feeder fish include mollies and
            mosquito fish. Goldfish are not suitable as marine fish food because they will lead to the development
            of liver problems in the predators that consume them.
            <br><br>f. Earthworms (Lumbricus) provide an excellent food source for marine fish. They should not be
            collected from areas exposed to pesticides and fertilizers. They can be shredded for smaller fish or fed
            whole to larger species. They are easily raised in plastic shoe box containers with potting soil and
            bran or oatmeal for food.
            <br><br>g. White worms (Enchytraeus sp.) are smaller than earthworms, reaching only about 2 cm. in
            length. They are nutritious but should only be fed sparingly because they are high in fat. They can be
            raised in plastic shoe box containers with potting soil and bran or oat meal for food.
            <br><br>h. Tubificid Worms include Tubifex sp. (red) and Lumbriculus sp. (black) worms that are very
            high in protein. Blackworms are usually cleaner than red worms because of black worms are usually
            cultured. They die quickly in saltwater so use a small clear bowl to lower them into the water and allow
            fish to eat them before they are swept away.
            <br><br>i. Mealworms are larvae of the beetle Tenebrio molitor and are easy to raise and feed to some
            predatory fish. They can be raised in plastic shoe boxes with whole oatmeal or wheat bran with a potato
            slice for food and moisture.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Frozen Foods</strong></h5>Frozen Foods include algae, worms, shrimp, and shellfish, among
            others. The freezing process alters the chemistry of the food somewhat, and vitamins C and E do decline
            over time. Vitamin supplements can counteract this. Defrosting the frozen food in water often causes the
            food to break up into bits often so small that fish cannot consume them. Furthermore, vitamins and
            minerals in the frozen food leach into the surrounding water and become unavailable to the fish. The
            excess uneaten organic material only adds to the chemical load in the aquarium water. Frozen foods are
            best allowed to thaw on a plastic surface and then placed directly into the aquarium for feeding.
            <br><br>a. Frozen Mysis shrimp is an excellent food source that is lacking only in pigment. Mysis are
            muscular freshwater shrimp that are high in protein and naturally occurring fatty acids. Since they are
            freshwater they should not be fed exclusively to fish. They should be thawed in a minimal amount of
            saltwater and then fed directly to fish to avoid fragmentation and the loss of nutrients from the
            shrimp.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Dry foods</strong></h5>Dry foods are processed versions of algae, shrimp, shellfish, and
            other foodstuffs. They have the advantage of a long shelf life. Dry foods are often lacking in some
            pigments and vitamins that live whole foods contain. Dry foods come in many forms, from flake to blocks,
            and include everything from algae to worms.
            <br><br>a. Flakes and Pellets are produced by a variety of companies and can contain a wide range of
            materials, from shrimp to algae. Different companies include different ingredients to produce different
            results in fish. Some have extra vitamins and minerals to enhance color. Others have higher protein to
            stimulate growth. Some types float for top feeders and other sink for bottom feeders. It is important to
            consider this when purchasing a dry food for a specific fish.
            <br><br>b. Spirulina is a blue green bacteria that is freeze dried to be fed to humans or fish. It is
            high in pigment and vitamins and is an excellent food for marine fish.
            <br><br>c. Porphyra and Palmaria seaweeds, known as Kelp and Nori, are excellent sources of vitamins,
            minerals, and lipids for fish. They can be bought from Oriental food stores and world wide web
            companies. Green seems to be the best for fish. Kelp and Nori are available as sheets, strips, or
            flakes.
            <br><br>d. Feeding blocks containing algae in a plaster-of-Paris cement allow fish to graze on algae as
            the plaster dissolves. The plaster adds calcium to the aquarium so it is harmless.
            <br><br>e. Freeze-Dried Foods include algae, worms, and shrimp. Their moisture content is removed very
            quickly under high pressure with a vacuum system and their nutrition remains high right up to feeding
            time. Freeze-dried foods are good at absorbing vitamin, mineral, and lipid supplements. Freeze-dried
            copepods maybe the best all-around food for marine fish with 50% protein, 35% lipids, 12% carbohydrate
            and carotenoid pigments. Freeze-dried krill (Euphausia) is also high in protein, fatty acids, carotenoid
            pigments, and vitamins. They should not be fed exclusively to fish to avoid a condition known as
            "lockjaw". Freeze-dried bloodworms (Chironomus) are actually insect larvae (midges). Because they are
            not marine, they are great for an occasional meal only.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Table Foods</strong></h5>Table Foods include vegetables and shellfish. Vegetables from the
            garden should only be used sparingly as marine fish food. Better types include romaine lettuce, peas,
            spinach, and broccoli. These should only be used sparingly because they are high in cellulose and can
            cause bloating in fish. All of the garden food types are high in nitrates and some contain oxalic acid
            (spinach) so they must be used with caution. Seafoods such as shellfish and fish are excellent sources
            of protein and fat for marine fish. Fresh shellfish, opened and exposed, are irresistible to some picky
            fish species.
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Home-Made Meals</strong></h5>Home-Made Meals can be prepared from seafood items bought at a
            grocery deli. Squid, shrimp, clams, scallops, mussels, and crab are good. Haddock and flounder are good
            fish. Avoid oily foods that help spoil aquarium water. Always use marine organisms for the food. Cut the
            pieces into bite-size portions for your fish and then roll them in aluminum foil or place in very small
            (drug-type) ziploc bags for future feedings.
          </p><br>
          <h2 id="health" class="anchor"><strong>Health</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Marine fish and invertebrate animal health are associated with the proper environmental conditions, good
            diet, and the absence of parasites that cause disease.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Environment:</strong></h5>
            The marine aquarium environment is likely the most important minute-to-minute factor that determines the
            health of a marine organism. The table below summarizes the basic water chemistry of a healthy marine
            aquarium:

            There are other trace minerals that are needed by organisms, ranging from iron to iodine. See the water
            quality section for more information.

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Diet:</strong></h5>
            - Diet is an important factor that determines the health of a marine organism. Diet cannot be satisfied
            by a single food source, even for herbivores.
            <br><br>- Herbivores of the sea, from lawnmower blennies to naso tangs, do feed on high quantities of
            algae material. But, along with their algae, comes a multitude of copepods and unicellular protozoans
            that were on or associated with the algae. These small animals are an important part of their food
            chain, and provide much needed protein supplementation in an otherwise low protein diet.
            <br><br>- Carnivores are not exclusive feeders on animals, which are low in certain vitamins and
            antioxidants. While many fish are zooplankton feeders, they also feed on unicellular algae that are in
            the water column. This is a significant part of their diet and an important source of vitamins. The
            digestive tracts of the copepods, shrimp, and plankton they eat also contain algae material that is
            beneficial to the carnivores health. The digestive tracts of processed and frozen shrimp are often
            devoid of food, and benefit the carnivores that eat them less.
            <br><br>- Omnivores feed at multiple food chain levels and so naturally require both algae and animals
            to feed upon. They are more likely to easily acclimate to aquarium life because of their varied dietary
            preferences.

            <h5><strong>Disease:</strong></h5>
            - Diseases can occur in marine aquaria despite the greatest preventive measures. An unhealthy or
            diseased state can be brought on by parasites, viruses, bacteria, environment, and even intervention
            procedures themselves. It is VERY important to have a 10 gallon aquarium with lid, heater, and powerhead
            to serve as a quarantine tank. New additions should always be sent to quarantine and observed for AT
            LEAST several days before introduction to the show aquarium.
            <br><br>- Parasites that attach marine organisms include worms, copepods, isopods, protozoa and more.
            They are generally introduced to an aquarium by the addition of new stock. They can spread rapidly and
            kill resident fish quickly, so treatments must be rapid. Solutions of copper, malachite green, formalin,
            chloroquine, and more.
            <br><br>- There are a number of gram negative bacterial species that attack marine fish, and they
            generally reside in the aquarium as part of the plankton or attached to the rock or sand bed particles.
            They will generally not cause disease until a fish is already stressed. Most parasitic infestations are
            accompanied by bacterial infection. The parasite was often introduced while the bacteria were already
            present. There are a few bacteria, such as Mycobacterium, that are not part of the normal flora of an
            aquarium. Therapies generally require antibiotics, including kanamycin (which is absorbed well by fish)
            and Furanace® (nitrofurazone - not absorbed by fish), and many others.
            <br><br>- Viruses attack fish and are very difficult to identify. They cannot be directly observed or
            cultured. There are few drug therapies that directly combat viruses. Generally, if water quality is
            improved and diet is enhanced, fish may overcome a viral infection on their own.
            <br><br>- Environmental factors can lead to the diseased state. High levels of nitrate or ammonia are
            destructive to the gills of a fish, leading to labored breathing and even death. Salinity, water
            hardness, pH, and temperature, and more all affect the health of a marine system. Collection techniques
            can lead to swim bladder and gas issues within the tissues of a fish. Excess copper or other trace
            minerals can be toxic to invertebrates. Any and all factors in the marine environment should be suspect
            when disease strikes.
            <br><br>- Interventions themselves can cause problems. Overfeeding and antibiotic use can lead to high
            levels of nitrates and ammonia, which must be remediated. All drugs have side effects, and the side
            effects must be addressed while a fish is isolated in a quarantine tank.
            See the <a href="#disease"><strong>Disease</strong></a> section below for more information.

          <h2 id="disease" class="anchor"><strong>Disease</strong></h2>
          <p>Marine fish diseases are often difficult to diagnose. The parasites that cause disease are usually far
            too small to see with the naked eye. Most marine fish caught on reefs have some type of parasite in or
            on their body. They bring the parasites with them into the fish store, and then on to a home aquarium.
            Thankfully, many of these parasites cannot reproduce in the aquarium and do not cause lethal disease.
            The few that do are listed below
            <br><br>
            Marine fish ailments can be caused by such agents as viruses, bacteria, protists, fungi, worms,
            crustaceans, and environmental factors. The following is a brief list of some of the causative agents of
            marine fish maladies:
            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Disease Parasites</strong></h5>
            1. Protozoan:
            <br>a. Flagellates (diplomonads):
            <br>- Hexamita and Spironucleus vortens are associated with Hole in the Head Disease
            <br>b. Ciliates:
            <br>- Cryptocaryon irritans is associated with Saltwater Ich
            <br>- Brooklynella hostilis is associated with Brooklynellosis
            <br>- Uronema marinum is associated with Uronemosis
            <br>c. Dinoflagellates:
            <br>- Amyloodinium ocellatum is associated with Marine Velvet Disease
            <br>d. Sporozoans:
            <br>- Glugea heraldi (microsporidian) is associated with Seahorse Disease
            <br>- Myxobolus cerebralis (myxsporidian) is associated with Whirling Disease
            <br><br> 2. Bacteria:
            <br>- Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Edwardsiella, Vibrio, Cytophaga are all gram negatives associated with fin
            rot, lesion, and skin hemorrhage
            <br>- Cytophaga is associated with White Skin Patch Disease
            <br>- Mycobacterium is associated with Piscine Tuberculosis
            <br>- Pseudomonas and Corynebacterium are associated with Swollen Abdomen and Raised Scales Diseases
            <br><br>3. Fungi:
            <br>- Saprolegnia is associated with external fungal infections (controversial relationship -
            Saprolegnia is a freshwater parasite)
            <br>- Ichthyophonus hoferi is associated with internal fungal infections
            <br><br>4. Virus:
            <br>- Iridoviruses are associated with Lymphocystis or Nodule Disease

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Animal Parasites</strong></h5>
            1. Worms
            <br>- Ichthyophaga, Paravortex and others are associated with Black Spot Disease or Tang Turbellarian
            <br>- Fluke Families Dactylogryidae and Genus Benedenia are associated with Fluke Infestations in Fishes
            <br><br> 2. Crustaceans: Isopods and Copepods
            <br>- Isopods: External skin parasites, resembling roly-polies, on fish
            <br>- Copepods: Embedded skin parasites beneath the skin of a fish

            <br><br>
            <h5><strong>Environmental Causes of Disease:</strong></h5>
            1. Gas Bubble Disease is associated with fish that have been:
            <br>- Collected at depths over 30 feet and rapidly brought to the surface
            <br>- Exposed to water that is supersaturated with gas
            <br> 2. Head and Lateral Line Erosion is associated with a variety of factors, including malnutrition,
            poor water quality, pathogens, stray voltage, activated carbon, copper, and other things.
            <br> 3. Malnutrition is associated with a diet lacking in protein and vitamins
            <br> 4. Swim Bladder Disorders are associated with fish brought to the surface too rapidly from deep
            reefs
            <br> 5. Iatrogenic Problems are associated with side effects from medications, such as ammonia build up
            in a hospital tank due to the death of nitrogen fixing bacteria.

          <h2 id="therapies" class="anchor"><strong>Therapies</strong></h2>
          <p>Important: SeaScape Studio treats its fish tanks with formalin and copper. The formalin is diluted from
            a 37% stock solution to .03 ml/L concentration. The copper is diluted from Mardel's CopperSafe at 5 ml/4
            gallons concentration. These two treatments cannot be used in the invertebrate tanks in the center of
            the store because of the vulnerability of invertebrates to copper and formalin</td>
