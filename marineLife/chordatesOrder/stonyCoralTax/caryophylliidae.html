                        <h1>Taxonomy: Scleractinia: Caryophylliidae (Stony Corals)</h1>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 85%;"><strong>Body Form:</strong> They have fleshy polyps with T-shaped tips. Their coralites grow
                            in long separated valleys producing a meandering body form. Most are shades of brown, green,
                            or blue.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong> Some have zooxanthellae and others are entirely heterotrophic. |
                            <strong>Care Level:</strong> Easy
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Natural History:</strong> The Caryophylliids all produce a similar wavy skeleton
                            with long plush polyps, usually extended day and night. Most species have tentacles with
                            stinging nematocysts that are capable of damaging other corals. Low to moderate light allows
                            most species to fully expand their fleshy tentacles. Most prefer low to moderate water flow.

                            <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong> The Euphyllia form wavy and ridged skeletons with long polyps that are completely retractable. Many species can be differentiated by their polyps rather than their skeleton. This genus is not hermatypic, but does possess zooxanthellae. This genus is generally observed in deeper reef zones than other stony corals.</h4>
                            <br><h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Frogspawn Coral are hardy in captivity and their decline usually indicates poor water quality. They may decline in the presence of some soft corals such as Sinularia. They prefer gentle water flow and moderate light best. They can produce long sweeper tentacles daily which can inflict a painful sting and damage other corals. Feeding can be observed when suspended food is offered. Colonies can reach 1 meter across.

                        <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong> Cat's Eye Bubble Coral are relatively rare on reefs. Their unusual bubble-like polyp extensions are often their identifying feature. The bubbles expand by day and retract at night to apparently increase photosynthesis via the zooxanthellae within. Thin feeding tentacles with potent nematocysts will often extend to feed at night. This genus is often found in shaded environments on reefs.</h4>
                        <br>h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> The Plerogyra can be grown under many light regimes but prosper if water flow is low or moderate. Their sweeper tentacles are damaging to nearly all other coral species. They may be damaged by introduction to very bright light (especially metal halides) when moved into a new aquarium. Colonies are generally less than 12 inches in diameter. This genus is susceptible to brown jelly infections caused by trauma to a polyp during movement. They are also vulnerable to flatworm infestations that can be removed with freshwater dips.

They prefer gentle water flow and moderate light best. They have formidable tentacles daily which can inflict a painful sting and damage other corals. Yet, Euphyllia (hammer and frogspawn corals) are dominant when they contact Elegance Corals. They should be kept on soft substrates in captivity away from live rock which can damage their inflated polyps.

            <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong> Snow White Bubble Coral are relatively rare on reefs. Their unusual bubble-like polyp extensions are often their identifying feature. The bubbles expand by day and retract at night to apparently increase photosynthesis via the zooxanthellae within. Thin feeding tentacles with potent nematocysts will often extend to feed at night. This genus is often found in shaded environments on reefs.</h4>
            <br> <h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> The Plerogyra can be grown under many light regimes but prosper if water flow is low or moderate. Their sweeper tentacles are damaging to nearly all other coral species. They may be damaged by introduction to very bright light (especially metal halides) when moved into a new aquarium. Colonies are generally less than 12 inches in diameter. This genus is susceptible to brown jelly infections caused by trauma to a polyp during movement. They are also vulnerable to flatworm infestations that can be removed with freshwater dips.
