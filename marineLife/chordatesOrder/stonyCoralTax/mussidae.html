                        <h3 style="font-size: 85%;"><strong>Body Form:</strong> Mussids are thick-tissue reef-building corals with large
                            corallites (skeletal unit). Most are colonial.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong> Some have zooxanthellae and others are entirely heterotrophic. |
                            <strong>Care Level:</strong> Easy
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Natural History:</strong> The Mussids are fairly common and conspicuous reef
                            inhabitants with bizaare shapes and body patterns. Most have large fleshy polyps and are
                            avid feeders on large planktonic foods. Light requirements are modest and, along with mild
                            to moderate water flow, most Mussids prosper in the aquarium. Some species are vulnerable to
                            toxins produced by the soft corals.

                <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong> Blastomussa have separate and tall corallites that extend from their massive skeleton. Colonies grow outward from the center and become separate, eventually competing with each other. When the polyps are fully extended, the skeleton becomes completely covered. The septa between colonies is bumpy or toothed. Colonies are dark red or brown, rare, and may reach 18 inches in diameter.</h4>
                <br><h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Blastomussa is a hardy coral found in low light and low water flow conditions. It is reported that cementing them to a vertical rock in an aquarium produces favorable growth results. Strong light may prevent them from expanding their polyps. They are rare in the aquarium trade because collection is difficult in deep and turbid waters. Freshwater dips may rid of flatworms that hide between the polyps of Blastomussa.

            <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong> The Acanthastrea are known only to the Pacific Ocean. Their polyps are fleshy and they grow in colonies with fused corallites. They resemble Faviids in overall appearance. Acans have heavier tissue covering their skeleton.</h4>
            <br><h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Acanthastrea grows best in mild water flow systems with moderate light. They should be fed plankton that is small enough to be fully ingested. They can extend sweeper tentacles for defense and should be kept away from other corals, especially soft corals. They are adaptable to a variety of low to moderate light and water flow conditions.

    | <strong>Temperament:</strong> Peaceful
    | <strong>Diet:</strong> These corals have zooxanthellae which provide much of their nutrition. It is believed they also feed on microzooplankton and directly absorb some nutrients from the water.</h9><br>

   
    <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong>  Blastomussa have separate and tall corallites that extend from their massive skeleton. Colonies grow outward from the center and become separate, eventually competing with each other. When the polyps are fully extended, the skeleton becomes completely covered. The septa between colonies is bumpy or toothed. Colonies are dark red or brown, rare, and may reach 18 inches in diameter.</h4>
    <br> <h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Blastomussa is a hardy coral found in low light and low water flow conditions. It is reported that cementing them to a vertical rock in an aquarium produces favorable growth results. Strong light may prevent them from expanding their polyps. They are rare in the aquarium trade because collection is difficult in deep and turbid waters. Freshwater dips may rid of flatworms that hide between the polyps of Blastomussa. They are hardy corals and survive well in aquaria.

    <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong> The Lobophyllia grow in patterns reminiscent of mammalian brain structures, with wavy ridges and grooves of polyps on wavy ridged and grooved skeletal backbones. Polyps are generally large. Most species are nocturnal and they extend their sweeper tentacles then to collect food. Colors include gray, dark green, red and brown.</h4>
    <br><h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> The Lobophyllia are hardy and tolerant of captivity. They readily feed on large planktonic offerings. They will produce sweeper tentacles at night but they are submissive to most other corals. They may decline in the presence of other corals that are placed too close.

They can extend sweeper tentacles for defense and should be kept away from other corals, especially soft corals.
