                        <h1>Taxonomy: Zoanthidea: Zoanthidae (Colonial Anemones)</h1>
                        <h6><strong>Body Form:</strong> The zoanthids are often found in small carpet-like colonies
                            growing on rock. They are soft-bodied. Their polyps may be solitary, connected via runners
                            (stolons), or massive (growing from a mat of mesoglea). Their polyp stalks and tentacles are
                            generally short. They may add materials from the substrate to their body for support.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>The zoanthids have zooxanthellae (algae) but they are predators and
                            most species feed on plankton. They also directly absorb nutrients from the water. Light
                            energy alone is not enough to sustain them. |
                            <strong>Care Level:</strong> Easy
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Natural History:</strong> The Zoanthids are primarily a colonial coral that are very
                            hardy and grow well in aquaria. Some species are symbiotic with sponges and are
                            aposematically (warning) colored and produce toxins. Some tolerate high wave action and
                            others grow in sheltered reef zones. Most species feed continuously - day and night. They
                            may infrequently slough off their outer surface to rid of algae and debris. Most species
                            have high density zooanthellae but do not rely on them exclusively for nutrition. Their
                            nematocysts are not potent but they may overgrow and smother neighboring coral colonies.
                            They are often found growing in polluted reef areas and they tolerate turbidity well. As a
                            group they produce palytoxin and seratonine.

                            <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong> The Zoanthus are a colonial genus. Their polyps are no more than one-half inch across, on short and fat stalks, short tentacles. They do not incorporate sediments into their mesoglea (as the Palythoa do). They reproduce by budding from the base of the parent colony (which is different from Palythoa which buds off of stolons). Zoanthus colonies are often so densely packed that the polyps are crowding each other on all sides. Their zooxanthellae and absorptive ability are the basis of their nutrition. Their colors are often bright and commonly include greens, yellows, oranges, and browns. Their larvae have been observed to crawl on the sand to new growth locations.</h4>
                            <h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Zoanthus prefer strong water flow and bright light. This genus is highly dependent on zooxanthellae photosynthesis. They will feed on sea urchin eggs. They do not have to be fed because of their reliance on photosynthesis and their ability to absorb dissolved nutrients, bacteria, and algae. They will change color shades according to their lighting regime and they are resistant to coral bleaching because of this.

                <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong>  The Palythoa are a colonial genus that cover large tracts of reef. They incoroporate sediments from the substrate and ocean around them and may accumulate almost half of their body weight in collected materials in their mesoglea. The polyps are round flat discs with short tentacles around the rim. The polyps can actually produce aragonite crystals, but only in small amounts. They are most common on the shoreward side of reef crests. Common colors include cream, yellow, and brown. The Palythoa can dominate a reef by growing over their competitors.</h4>
                <h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Palythoa prefer moderate to strong water flow and bright light. Palythoa are very competitive and will kill most other species of corals that are housed too closely. They produce a very potent neurotoxin, secreted in their mucus, that can be deadly to humans. Care should be employed in handling them! They are aggressive through growth and can cover other corals.

    <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong>  The Zoanthus are a colonial genus. Their polyps are no more than one-half inch across, on short and fat stalks, short tentacles. They do not incorporate sediments into their mesoglea (as the Palythoa do). They reproduce by budding from the base of the parent colony (which is different from Palythoa which buds off of stolons). Zoanthus colonies are often so densely packed that the polyps are crowding each other on all sides. Their zooxanthellae and absorptive ability are the basis of their nutrition. Their colors are often bright and commonly include greens, yellows, oranges, and browns. Their larvae have been observed to crawl on the sand to new growth locations.</h4>
    <h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Zoanthus prefer strong water flow and bright light. This genus is highly dependent on zooxanthellae photosynthesis. They will feed on sea urchin eggs. They do not have to be fed because of their reliance on photosynthesis and their ability to absorb dissolved nutrients, bacteria, and algae. They will change color shades according to their lighting regime and they are resistant to coral bleaching because of this.

    <h4><strong>Natural History:</strong>  The Zoanthus are a colonial genus. Their polyps are no more than one-half inch across, on short and fat stalks, short tentacles. They do not incorporate sediments into their mesoglea (as the Palythoa do). They reproduce by budding from the base of the parent colony (which is different from Palythoa which buds off of stolons). Zoanthus colonies are often so densely packed that the polyps are crowding each other on all sides. Their zooxanthellae and absorptive ability are the basis of their nutrition. Their colors are often bright and commonly include greens, yellows, oranges, and browns. Their larvae have been observed to crawl on the sand to new growth locations.</h4>
    <h4><strong>Husbandry:</strong> Zoanthus prefer strong water flow and bright light. This genus is highly dependent on zooxanthellae photosynthesis. They will feed on sea urchin eggs. They do not have to be fed because of their reliance on photosynthesis and their ability to absorb dissolved nutrients, bacteria, and algae. They will change color shades according to their lighting regime and they are resistant to coral bleaching because of this.
